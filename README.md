# 1. Introduction

`secs-simulator` is a visually appealing, easy-to-use tool with high flexibility in auto-reply for SEC S/GEM testing and device simulation.

Developed based on `electron-egg`, using `arco-design-vue` as the UI component library and `secs4js` as the SEC S/GEM communication library.
